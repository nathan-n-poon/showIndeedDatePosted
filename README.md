> The causes lie deep and simple—the causes are a hunger in a stomach, multiplied a million times; a hunger in a single soul, hunger for joy and some security, multiplied a million times; muscles and mind aching to grow, to work, to create, multiplied a million times. The last clear definite function of man—muscles aching to work, minds aching to create beyond the single need—this is man. To build a wall, to build a house, a dam, and in the wall and house and dam to put something of Manself, and to Manself take back something of the wall, the house, the dam; to take hard muscles from the lifting, to take the clear lines and form from conceiving.

This is a plugin that displays the posted date for jobs on Indeed.  This is normally shown only for some jobs, though the info is sent to the client for many more besides.  Basically this plugin saves you a couple clicks through the source inspector.  I'm wrastling with a fairly uncooperative iss, so the functionality of this is severly limited by some caveats, so I dont think this wil be published as an actual plugin.

Caveats:
- AFAIK, only the dateposted info for the initial batch of loaded jobs is sent when on the root directory of indeed.  That means any additional jobs loaded in will not have their info available whilst remaining on the same page.  The only way to get this info from my plugin would be to open the job in in its own page (right click, open link in new tab).
 - only tested on firefox (cbb with TOR documentation)
